Search Concerts with Bands In Town

To search for a concert just type "node liri concert-this any artist who is touring". LIRI will then take the search and apply it to the Bands In Town API and return the soonest result for a concert for that artist. Below is an image of a BandsInTown search. I underlined in red how to type the command.
